# Description#
This is currently my setup for a bootstrapping a static web HTML/CSS/JS project using the Compass Framework and SASS. I opted to not use Compass' reset and instead use the HTML5 Boilerplate CSS stylesheet for a base reset.

## How to Use ##
All Compass+SASS related files are in the /compass folder.
The config file is set up to be ready to go. For your edits in /compass/sass/ css to be compiled automatically, run the watcher command `compass watch` within the /compass folder. Then all your changes in the SASS files will be compiled into the css folder.

*Note*: You can either create an empty /css directory at trunk level or it will be created with the initial SASS to CSS compilation.
