This is currently my setup for a static project using the Compass Framework +
SASS. I opted to not use Compass' reset and instead use the HTML5Boilerplate
CSS stylesheet for a base reset.

All Compass+SASS related files are in the /compass folder.
The config file is set up to be ready to go, just run the command:
`compass watch`
And then all your changes in the SASS files will be compiled into the css folder.
