#UPDATE!
__I've created a new project called <a href="https://github.com/xtine/firestarter">firestarter</a> using gulp/bourbon instead.__<br/>
*I will no longer maintain this repo and will be leaving it here for legacy reasons.*


# Description #
This is my setup for bootstrapping a static web project with using Compass, SASS, and HTML5 Boilerplate.

## How to Use ##
All Compass and SASS related files are in the /compass folder.
The config file is set up to be ready to go. For your edits in /compass/sass/ css to be compiled automatically, run the watcher command `compass watch` within the /compass folder. Then all your changes in the SASS (.scss) files will be compiled into the /css folder.

### CSS Files (/css) ###
The base CSS file (/css/style.css) is pre-compiled using the HTML5 Boilerplate approved normalize.css. If compass is watching the /compass/sass folder then all your edits will truncate over styles.css. Make sure to only edit the .scss files.

### JavaScript Files (/js) ###
Libraries are stored in the /js/libs folder, including jQuery and Modernizr.
There is a starter file (script.js) supplied so you can start writing base JavaScript, but feel free to replace or use other frameworks and libraries to your choosing.

### Image Files (/img) ###
Create a folder named /img at trunk level and place your images there. You can also create additional folders to use with the Compass spriting engine (make sure to include @import "sprites/*.png" in base stylesheet).
